# Credit-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction
This repository belongs to Virtual Internship Experience or VIX in ID/X Partners held by Rakamin Academy 

As an intern Data Scientist at ID/X Partners, I am involved in a company project. I collaborate with various other departments to provide solutions, specifically building models that can predict credit risk using datasets provided by the company, consisting of data received and rejected loans.
